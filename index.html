            <li><a class="links" href="https://info.flipgrid.com/"><strong class="edtech-tools">Flipgrid</strong></a>- this tool allows for discussion between students using video. This can be more engaging and interactive for students than a normal discussion forum</li>
            <li><a class="links" href="https://www.remind.com/"><strong class="edtech-tools">Remind</strong></a>- this tool was used by one of my high school instructors to send out reminders to students phones without using her personal number. I found it to be a very professional and effective way for instructors to share information.</li>
            <li><a class="links" href="https://padlet.com/dashboard"><strong class="edtech-tools">Padlet</strong></a>- this tool allows for interactive boards that students can share ideas on, or it can be used as a personal board for students to post progress for their projects and assignments</li>
